This repository contains the code for the Master project "Predicing concreteness by featurizing word associations" (from 21.08.2023)
The project investigates several association relationships with word concreteness in Brysbaert et al.'s (2014) word concreteness ratings and DeDeyne et al.'s (2019) data.
Those association relationships are used in predicting concreteness with linear regression as well as logistic regression, both with feature reductive penalisations.
We conduct two types of modelling: with individual feature representations to compare model performance by features, and with all-feature representations to compare feature importance
The tested association relationships are:
- M1: A difference in the amount of association types for concrete and abstract targets
- M2: A difference in the strength of association for concrete and abstarct targets
- M3: A difference in the semnatic relation of target and association for concrete and abstract targets
- M4: A difference in the semantic realtions between the target's associations for concrete and abstract targets
- M5:  A difference in the amount of types in associated wordclasses for concrete and abstract targets

This repository includes:
- The code for building the target-association matrixes for each association relationhsip (aka indivifual feature representations): "AssociationTable_XXX"
- The code for building the all-feature representations: "FeatureTable"
- The code for the linear regression individual feature modelling: "LinearRegression_ElasticNet"
- The code for the logistic regression individual feature modelling: "LogisticRegression_ElasticNet"
- The code for the all-feature modelling feature importance and model performance: "FeatureModel"
